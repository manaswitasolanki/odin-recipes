    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I've been messing around trying to make a perfect strawberry cupcake to go with the Real Strawberry Frosting I developed a couple of years ago. It's been a long road and lots of cupcakes tested and tasted along the way. The trick was NOT using puree as I do when making the frosting. Rather, grinding freeze-dried strawberries into a powder brought this cupcake recipe out of my test kitchen and into my recipe box! I am so pleased with the results!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>1 1/4 ounces freeze-dried strawberries</li>
         <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>¾ cup cake flour</li>
         <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
         <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
         <li>1⅓ cups white sugar</li>
         <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
         <li>⅔ cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin tins with 20 cupcake liners (for mini cupcakes, line 72 mini muffin tins).</li>
        <li>Grind strawberries into a fine powder using a coffee grinder or food processor. Whisk strawberry powder, all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Stir flour mixture, alternately with the milk, into butter mixture until just incorporated. Fill lined tins with cupcake batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cupcakes spring back when gently touched with a fingertip or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes for regular cupcakes, 8 to 10 minutes for mini cupcakes.</li>
    </ol>
